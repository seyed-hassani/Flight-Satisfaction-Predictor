#  Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

This project focuses on predicting airline passenger satisfaction based on various features related to the flight experience, service quality, and passenger demographics. The model is trained using a deep neural network implemented in Keras.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset includes two files:

- `train.csv`: Contains labeled training samples including the target column `satisfaction`.
- `test.csv`: Contains unlabeled test samples. Your model should predict the `satisfaction` column for these.
